#### Description:
My Final Project is A manifestation app inspired by the nikola Tesla 369 manifestation method which became popular on Tiktok involves writing down what you'd like to manifest three times in the morning, six times during the day, and nine times in the evening, built with swift uikit. And although studies have shown Manifestation on pen and paper, digital Manifestation is also effective and can be used as an alternative for the ordinary paper and pen manifestation. Some features of the app include : 1, It allows you to Create an account or Log in to existing account to keep track of your activities, login details are stored on the google firebase to keep track of the users, their email and passwords and allows users to sign in to their accounts at any time.The coding used in the signup and login view controllers, check to ensure the validity of the email to make sure the email exists and verifies if the password is strong enough to ensure the strength of the password.Another feature of the app is it allows storage of all your manifestations in one place according to the time of Manifestation e.g morning Manifestation (3) is stored in a separate folder to keep it organised, on the home page to make it easy to access and use.3, Because the first step to manifestation is deciding what you want to manifest which can be a hassle sometimes and sometimes long, tiring and confusing trying to separate your manifestations from your goals, since goals can be numerous things and manifestations can only be single things, the app allows you to write your goals down so you can tell what your manifestations and goals apart. It allows you to write your short and long termed goals in a single place to keep track of them and the day you manifested them or the day you'd like to achieve the goal also keeping the goals in the order in which they were written to make sure they remain organised, And you can delete them anytime the goal was reached. The standard amount of time usually used to manifest is 33 days, you can manifest for longer or shorter depending on whenever your manifestations were fulfilled which is why the app Also with a clock tracker you can see how long you intend on manifesting and how many days, hours , minutes and second remain for you to complete your manifestations along with what you are manifesting , You Can also Keep an eye on the signs from the universe with angel numbers and what they mean , you can also see what to do when you see those angel numbers and how many angel numbers exist and which set of numbers are angel numbers by asking laya the in-house assistant, Help allows you to type in your question and get immediate response to the question you asked , also a list of questions laya is programmed to answer.And also Get time based notification to remind you to manifest throughout the day.
